This is a web app for cataloging and lending sports equipment developed with a team of UVA students.

It uses the Django framework and was formerly deployed with Heroku.

I contributed to the project as a full-stack developer and also handled all DevOps tasks, including Heroku deployment, S3 media storage, GitHub Actions, and Google Sign-In integration.
